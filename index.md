## About

A group of friends that decided to contribute to the community by starting to organize events where we could gather everyone interested in all the topics regarding testing.

At each event we start with one or two presentations and then discuss these and other themes along with a coffee break provided by the host company.

<p>
If you just want to share any idea, just talk to anyone in the organization on <a href="https://portotestersmeetup.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> (you can join by talking with one of the staff members) or in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/PortoTestersMeetup/" target="_blank">Facebook group</a>.
</p>
