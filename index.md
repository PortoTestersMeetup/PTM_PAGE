<h1> About </h1>

<p>
  A group of friends that decided to contribute to the community by starting to organize events where we could gather everyone interested in all the topics regarding testing.
</p> 
<p>
  At each event we start with one or two presentations and then discuss these and other themes along with a coffee break provided by the host company.
</p>
